# Build a memory game

> This repository is the companion to the ["Build a memory game"](https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/build-a-memory-game/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=memory-game) practice exercise.

Build a memory game in React.

You start with 6 images that you will display as 12 cards. By default, they are "flipped" - you only get a placeholder instead of the image.

As the user clicks a "card", flip it around, revealing the image.
When the user clicks the same picture twice, in a row, then it means he has a match - so keep the images visible from then onwards.

To get started, you can clone this starter repo.
When you're ready to check your work, check out [the official solution](https://reactpractice.dev/solution/how-to-build-a-memory-game/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=memory-game).

## Getting started:
